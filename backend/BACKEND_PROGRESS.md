- [ ] Refactor any duplicate code
- [ ] Update deprecated dependencies
- [ ] Improve TypeScript strict mode compliance

### Documentation
- [ ] API endpoint documentation completion
- [ ] Code documentation (JSDoc)
- [ ] Architecture decision records (ADRs)

- [ ] Deployment guide

### Database
- [ ] Review and optimize database schema
- [ ] Add missing foreign key constraints
- [ ] Implement soft delete consistently
- [ ] Add database backup strategy
- [ ] Migration rollback procedures

## Known Issues

1. **Database Sync**: Currently using synchronize in development - need to ensure all changes are captured in migrations
2. **Error Messages**: Some error messages expose internal details - need sanitization
3. **Rate Limiting**: Current implementation is basic - needs per-endpoint configuration
4. **File Uploads**: No file upload handling implemented yet
5. **Search**: Search functionality is basic string matching - needs full-text search

## Release Checklist

Before deploying to production:
- [ ] All critical tests passing
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Backup strategy implemented
- [ ] Load testing completed

## Notes

- Priority levels can be adjusted based on business requirements
- Each task should be broken down into smaller subtasks when picked up
- Consider creating GitHub issues for tracking individual tasks
- Update this document as tasks are completed or new requirements emerge
