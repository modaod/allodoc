# Next Session Priority Tasks

## ‚úÖ Completed Since Last Update (Aug 13, 2025)
- Dashboard API 500 errors - FIXED
- User registration backend integration - DONE
- Organization dropdown in registration - IMPLEMENTED
- Auth pages UI consistency - COMPLETED
- Dynamic organization fetching - WORKING

## üéØ Next Session Focus

### 1. Advanced Search & Filtering (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Why**: Most impactful for daily use, improves UX significantly
**Implementation**:
- Add search bars to patient, consultation, prescription lists
- Implement backend search endpoints with proper pagination
- Add date range filters and sorting options
- Use debounced search for performance

### 2. File Upload System (MEDIUM-HIGH)
**Why**: Essential for complete medical records
**Implementation**:
- Setup multer for file uploads in backend
- Add file attachment to consultations
- Support PDF, images (JPG, PNG)
- Create file viewer/download component
- Consider storage strategy (local vs. cloud)

### 3. Password Reset Flow (CRITICAL for Production)
**Why**: Must-have security feature
**Implementation**:
- Create forgot password page
- Setup email service (nodemailer/SendGrid)
- Generate secure reset tokens
- Create password reset form with validation
- Design email templates

## üìã Quick Wins (Can be done in 1-2 hours)

### 1. Add Loading Skeletons
- Replace simple spinners with skeleton screens
- Better perceived performance
- Material Angular has built-in skeleton components

### 2. Improve Error Messages
- Replace generic alerts with Material snackbars
- Add specific error messages for common scenarios
- Implement retry mechanisms

### 3. Add Confirmation Dialogs
- Delete confirmations for patients/consultations
- Unsaved changes warnings
- Logout confirmation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

### 1. Performance
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- Add pagination to all list endpoints
- Optimize bundle size (currently exceeds budget)
- Consider lazy loading more modules

### 2. Security
- Add password complexity validation
- Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Add CSRF protection
- Consider 2FA implementation

### 3. Testing
- Setup Jest for backend unit tests
- Configure Karma for frontend tests
- Add critical path E2E tests
- Aim for 60%+ coverage

## üìù Architecture Decisions to Make

### 1. State Management
**Question**: Should we implement NgRx?
**Pros**: Better state management, time-travel debugging
**Cons**: Added complexity, learning curve
**Recommendation**: Wait until app grows more complex

### 2. File Storage
**Question**: Local storage vs. Cloud (S3/Azure)?
**Pros of Cloud**: Scalable, CDN support, backup
**Cons of Cloud**: Cost, complexity
**Recommendation**: Start local, migrate to cloud later

### 3. Email Service
**Question**: Nodemailer vs. SendGrid/Mailgun?
**Pros of Services**: Better deliverability, analytics
**Cons of Services**: Cost, external dependency
**Recommendation**: Use SendGrid free tier
